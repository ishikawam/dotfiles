# CLAUDE.md - Global Configuration

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## ï¿½ IMPORTANT RULES

**NEVER COMMIT CODE WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER REQUEST**
- Do NOT run `git commit` unless the user explicitly asks to commit
- Do NOT run `git add` and `git commit` automatically
- Always ask for confirmation before committing changes
- The user wants to review changes before they are committed to version control
- This rule is non-negotiable and must be followed at all times

**GIT COMMIT POLICY**
- NEVER automatically run `git add` before committing
- When user says "git commit", only commit files that are already staged (added)
- Do NOT stage additional files without explicit user instruction
- Only commit what the user has manually staged with `git add`
- If no files are staged, inform the user that there are no staged changes to commit

**FILE CREATION POLICY**
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User

**SECURITY BEST PRACTICES**
- Always follow security best practices
- Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys
- Never commit secrets or keys to the repository

**CODE STYLE**
- DO NOT ADD ***ANY*** COMMENTS unless asked
- When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions
- Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns

**RESTRICTED FILES**
- NEVER modify or touch ~/.config/git/ignore
- This file must remain untouched at all times
